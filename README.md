xevkeycode
==========

Problem: I want to set more key bindings for my window manager, but I need to know the codes and
the symbol names. I'm supposed to run `xev` and read its rather verbose output. Why not filter just
the parts I need?

Solution: This script will launch `xev` and pick just the right parts from its output stream. All
you have to do is press keys in `xev` and then read the output in your terminal.

Enjoy!
